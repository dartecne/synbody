Wearable Wireless MIDI controller for Sound Generation by Body Movements

The project is divide in two:
- v1 - is a wearable prototype set that includes 2 ADXL335 accelerometers, 1 SHARP IR sensor, and 4 Switches that are connected by Bluetooth.
- v2 - is a wearable prototype set that includes 2 ADXL335 accelerometers, and 2 ADXL345 accelerometers that are connected by XBee.

Each project has two different applications.
- Sensor Control System, that is implemented in Arduino-v.1.8.5
- MIDI Control System, that is implemented in Processing-v.1.5.1 using controlP5
